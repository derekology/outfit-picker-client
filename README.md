# welcome

## what is this?
a web app that randomly selects a top and bottom from a database of clothing (separated by user).

## but why?
i started this project as a way to learn more about what makes our digital world go 'round.

it was meant to be fairly basic but as it got off the ground, i kept thinking of new features to add. the resulting code is a representation of this mish-mash of ideas and exploratory nature of the project.

## what's next?
as much fun as this has been (and still is), i think i will pursue some formal education to deepen my understanding of core concepts that are often missed when self-learning.

however, that's not to say that i'm done with my outfit picker. on the contrary, i still have a very lively to-do list and am always open to comments or feedback from the community.
